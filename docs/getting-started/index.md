## Learning Path

**Core Path (Required):**
1. **101 - First Simulation**: Launch the app, open a circuit, run simulation, view results
2. **102 - Basic Circuits**: Build circuits from scratch, component library, wiring
3. **103 - PWM Basics**: Pulse-width modulation, duty cycle, control-power interface
4. **104 - Running Simulations**: Solver settings, time step, troubleshooting, data export

**Extended Topics (Optional):**
5. **105 - Analysis Tools**: Steady-state analysis, Bode plots, frequency response
6. **106 - State Machines**: Complex control sequences, startup/shutdown, fault handling
7. **107 - Component Libraries**: Create and manage custom component libraries

## Prerequisites

- GeckoCIRCUITS installed and running
- Basic understanding of electrical circuits
- Java 21 runtime

## What You'll Learn

By completing this series, you will be able to:
- Navigate the GeckoCIRCUITS interface
- Build and modify circuit schematics
- Configure and run simulations
- View and analyze results in the oscilloscope
- Export data for external analysis
- Understand PWM control basics
- Perform frequency-domain analysis
- Implement state-based control logic
- Create reusable component libraries

## Estimated Total Time

- Core tutorials (101-104): 1.5-2 hours
- Extended tutorials (105-107): 2-2.5 hours
- Complete series: 3.5-4.5 hours
