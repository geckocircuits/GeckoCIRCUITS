 * Returns a function that lets you navigate programmatically in the browser in

 *
 * It's often better to use {@link redirect} in [`action`](../../start/framework/route-module#action)/[`loader`](../../start/framework/route-module#loader)
 * functions than this hook.
 *
 * The returned function signature is `navigate(to, options?)`/`navigate(delta)` where:
 *
 * * `to` can be a string path, a {@link To} object, or a number (delta)
 * * `options` contains options for modifying the navigation
 *   * These options work in all modes (Framework, Data, and Declarative):
 *     * `relative`: `"route"` or `"path"` to control relative routing logic
 *     * `replace`: Replace the current entry in the [`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) stack
 *     * `state`: Optional [`history.state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/state) to include with the new {@link Location}
 *   * These options only work in Framework and Data modes:
 *     * `flushSync`: Wrap the DOM updates in [`ReactDom.flushSync`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/flushSync)
 *     * `preventScrollReset`: Do not scroll back to the top of the page after navigation
 *     * `viewTransition`: Enable [`document.startViewTransition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition) for this navigation
 *
 * @example
 * import { useNavigate } from "react-router";
 *
 * function SomeComponent() {
 *   let navigate = useNavigate();
 *   return (
 *     <button onClick={() => navigate(-1)}>
 *       Go Back
 *     </button>
 *   );
 * }
 *
 * @additionalExamples
 * ### Navigate to another path
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate("/some/route");
 * navigate("/some/route?search=param");
 * ```
 *
 * ### Navigate with a {@link To} object
 *
 * All properties are optional.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate({
 *   pathname: "/some/route",
 *   search: "?search=param",
 *   hash: "#hash",
 *   state: { some: "state" },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * If you use `state`, that will be available on the {@link Location} object on
 * the next page. Access it with `useLocation().state` (see {@link useLocation}).
 *
 * ### Navigate back or forward in the history stack
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // back
 * // often used to close modals
 * navigate(-1);
 *
 * // forward
 * // often used in a multistep wizard workflows
 * navigate(1);
 * ```
 *
 * Be cautious with `navigate(number)`. If your application can load up to a
 * route that has a button that tries to navigate forward/back, there may not be
 * a `[`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
 * entry to go back or forward to, or it can go somewhere you don't expect
 * (like a different domain).
 *
 * Only use this if you're sure they will have an entry in the [`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
 * stack to navigate to.
 *
 * ### Replace the current entry in the history stack
 *
 * This will remove the current entry in the [`History`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)
 * stack, replacing it with a new one, similar to a server side redirect.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate("/some/route", { replace: true });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Prevent Scroll Reset
 *
 * [MODES: framework, data]
 *
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 *
 * To prevent {@link ScrollRestoration | `<ScrollRestoration>`} from resetting
 * the scroll position, use the `preventScrollReset` option.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * navigate("?some-tab=1", { preventScrollReset: true });
 * ```
 *
 * For example, if you have a tab interface connected to search params in the
 * middle of a page, and you don't want it to scroll to the top when a tab is
 * clicked.
 *
 * ### Return Type Augmentation
 *
 * Internally, `useNavigate` uses a separate implementation when you are in
 * Declarative mode versus Data/Framework mode - the primary difference being
 * that the latter is able to return a stable reference that does not change
 * identity across navigations. The implementation in Data/Framework mode also
 * returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
 * that resolves when the navigation is completed. This means the return type of
 * `useNavigate` is `void | Promise<void>`. This is accurate, but can lead to
 * some red squigglies based on the union in the return value:
 *
 * - If you're using `typescript-eslint`, you may see errors from
 *   [`@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises)
 * - In Framework/Data mode, `React.use(navigate())` will show a false-positive
 *   `Argument of type 'void | Promise<void>' is not assignable to parameter of
 *   type 'Usable<void>'` error
 *
 * The easiest way to work around these issues is to augment the type based on the
 * router you're using:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // If using <BrowserRouter>
 * declare module "react-router" {
 *   interface NavigateFunction {
 *     (to: To, options?: NavigateOptions): void;
 *     (delta: number): void;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // If using <RouterProvider> or Framework mode
 * declare module "react-router" {
 *   interface NavigateFunction {
 *     (to: To, options?: NavigateOptions): Promise<void>;
 *     (delta: number): Promise<void>;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @public
 * @category Hooks
 * @returns A navigate function for programmatic navigation
 */
declare function useNavigate(): NavigateFunction;
/**
 * Returns the parent route {@link Outlet | `<Outlet context>`}.
 *
 * Often parent routes manage state or other values you want shared with child
 * routes. You can create your own [context provider](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
 * if you like, but this is such a common situation that it's built-into
 * {@link Outlet | `<Outlet>`}.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // Parent route
 * function Parent() {
 *   const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
 *   return <Outlet context={[count, setCount]} />;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ```tsx
 * // Child route
 * import { useOutletContext } from "react-router";
 *
 * function Child() {
 *   const [count, setCount] = useOutletContext();
 *   const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1);
 *   return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you're using TypeScript, we recommend the parent component provide a
 * custom hook for accessing the context value. This makes it easier for
 * consumers to get nice typings, control consumers, and know who's consuming
 * the context value.
 *
 * Here's a more realistic example:
 *
 * ```tsx filename=src/routes/dashboard.tsx lines=[14,20]
 * import { useState } from "react";
 * import { Outlet, useOutletContext } from "react-router";
 *
 * import type { User } from "./types";
 *
 * type ContextType = { user: User | null };
 *
 * export default function Dashboard() {
 *   const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
 *
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <h1>Dashboard</h1>
 *       <Outlet context={{ user } satisfies ContextType} />
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 *
 * export function useUser() {
 *   return useOutletContext<ContextType>();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ```tsx filename=src/routes/dashboard/messages.tsx lines=[1,4]
 * import { useUser } from "../dashboard";
 *
 * export default function DashboardMessages() {
 *   const { user } = useUser();
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       <h2>Messages</h2>
 *       <p>Hello, {user.name}!</p>
 *     </div>
 *   );

 * then `params.postId` will be `"123"`.
 *
 * @example
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * function SomeComponent() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   params.postId;
 * }
 *
 * @additionalExamples
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * // given a route like:
 * <Route path="/posts/:postId" element={<Post />} />;
 *
 * // or a data route like:
 * createBrowserRouter([

 *     component: Post,
 *   },
 * ]);
 *
 * // or in routes.ts
 * route("/posts/:postId", "routes/post.tsx");
 * ```
 *
 * Access the params in a component:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * export default function Post() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   return <h1>Post: {params.postId}</h1>;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Multiple Params
 *
 * Patterns can have multiple params:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * "/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId";
 * ```
 *
 * All will be available in the params object:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * export default function Post() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   return (
 *     <h1>
 *       Post: {params.postId}, Comment: {params.commentId}
 *     </h1>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Catchall Params
 *
 * Catchall params are defined with `*`:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * "/files/*";
 * ```
 *
 * The matched value will be available in the params object as follows:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useParams } from "react-router";
 *
 * export default function File() {
 *   let params = useParams();
 *   let catchall = params["*"];
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can destructure the catchall param:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * export default function File() {
 *   let { "*": catchall } = useParams();
 *   console.log(catchall);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @public
 * @category Hooks
 * @returns An object containing the dynamic route parameters

 * Allow the application to block navigations within the SPA and present the

 *
 * The {@link Blocker} object returned by the hook has the following properties:
 *
 * - **`state`**
 *   - `unblocked` - the blocker is idle and has not prevented any navigation
 *   - `blocked` - the blocker has prevented a navigation
 *   - `proceeding` - the blocker is proceeding through from a blocked navigation
 * - **`location`**
 *   - When in a `blocked` state, this represents the {@link Location} to which
 *     we blocked a navigation. When in a `proceeding` state, this is the
 *     location being navigated to after a `blocker.proceed()` call.
 * - **`proceed()`**
 *   - When in a `blocked` state, you may call `blocker.proceed()` to proceed to
 *     the blocked location.
 * - **`reset()`**
 *   - When in a `blocked` state, you may call `blocker.reset()` to return the
 *     blocker to an `unblocked` state and leave the user at the current
 *     location.
 *
 * @example
 * // Boolean version
 * let blocker = useBlocker(value !== "");

 *   ({ currentLocation, nextLocation, historyAction }) =>
 *     value !== "" &&
