## Post Content

5 weeks. 15 posts. From Modified Nodal Analysis to complete circuit simulation. Here's what we learned.

**Week 1: MNA Foundations**

Monday: Introduced A·x = b formulation
Wednesday: IMatrixStamper interface (Strategy pattern)
Friday: Article hype

Weekend Article: "Modified Nodal Analysis: From Kirchhoff to Code"
- MNA theory and stamping pattern
- ResistorStamper implementation
- Worked examples by hand

**Week 2: Time Integration**

Monday: Why capacitors aren't resistors (differential equations)
Wednesday: CapacitorStamper code (admittance = C/dt)
Friday: Article hype

Weekend Article: "Matrix Stamping Deep-Dive: R, L, C Components"
- Backward Euler vs Trapezoidal
- Time-dependent stamping
- Transient analysis examples

**Week 3: Performance**

Monday: Sparse matrices (99% zeros → 200x memory savings)
Wednesday: Cholesky decomposition (2x faster than LU)
Friday: Article hype

Weekend Article: "Sparse Matrices & Cholesky: The Speed Behind SPICE"
- Sparse storage formats
- Symbolic + numerical factorization
- Performance benchmarks

**Week 4: Nonlinear Components**

Monday: Why diodes break MNA (exponential I-V)
Wednesday: Newton-Raphson iteration code
Friday: Article hype

Weekend Article: "Nonlinear Simulation: Newton-Raphson & Solver Comparison"
- Diode linearization
- Convergence criteria
- Backward Euler vs Trapezoidal vs Gear-Shichman

**Week 5: Complete System**

Monday: Simulation pipeline (file → scope)
Wednesday: Signal processing (FFT, THD, CISPR16)
Today: This recap

Weekend Article: "GeckoCIRCUITS Architecture: A Complete Tour"
- Full system walkthrough
- Design patterns used
- REST API integration
- What's next for the project

**What You Now Know:**

✓ How SPICE/PLECS/GeckoCIRCUITS work internally
✓ Why circuit simulators are fast (sparse Cholesky)
✓ How to implement custom component models
✓ Why "convergence failed" happens (and how to fix it)
✓ Complete system architecture (interfaces, solvers, signal processing)

**What's Next?**

I want to hear from you. What should I cover next?

**Poll:** (Pick one)
A) AC analysis (small-signal, Bode plots, stability)
B) Optimization (parameter sweeps, gradient descent)
C) Multi-physics (thermal-electrical co-simulation)
D) Advanced topics (state-space, model order reduction)

Comment with your choice!

**Thank You**

To everyone who followed this 5-week journey: Thank you.

You stuck with me through matrices, derivatives, and code. That takes dedication.

**Final CTAs:**
