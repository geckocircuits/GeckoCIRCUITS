## Post Content

This weekend's deep-dive article is ready. Here's what you'll learn.

Monday: I introduced Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)
Wednesday: I showed you the actual GeckoCIRCUITS code

Tomorrow (Saturday): The complete deep-dive drops.

Here's what's inside "Modified Nodal Analysis: From Kirchhoff to Code"

📐 THEORY (30%)
→ Why MNA beats mesh and nodal analysis
→ The A·x = b formulation explained
→ What "modified" actually means
→ Ground nodes and reference points

💻 CODE WALKTHROUGH (40%)
→ IMatrixStamper interface line-by-line
→ ResistorStamper implementation
→ How the simulation engine uses stampers
→ Component registry pattern

🔧 WORKED EXAMPLES (20%)
→ 3-resistor voltage divider (hand calculation + code)
→ RC circuit (introduces time dependency)
→ Bridge circuit (4 components)
→ Step-by-step matrix formation

✏️ EXERCISES (10%)
→ 3 circuits for you to try
→ Solutions provided
→ Verify against GeckoCIRCUITS

Reading time: 15 minutes
Code examples: 6 snippets
Exercises: 3 circuits
Difficulty: Intermediate (basic circuit theory + programming)

Why read this?
✓ Understand how SPICE/PLECS/GeckoCIRCUITS work internally
✓ Learn to extend GeckoCIRCUITS with custom components
✓ Teach circuit simulation to students
✓ Debug simulation issues by understanding the engine

Who is this for?
→ Power electronics engineers using circuit simulators
→ Students learning circuit simulation
→ Researchers needing custom component models
→ Developers contributing to open-source simulation

The article drops tomorrow morning on Substack.
